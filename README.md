Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a coder based in Bengaluru, Karnataka, India. This profile is primarily focused on academic-related projects and experiments.  

## About Me  
I have experience with programming languages such as C, C++, and Python, and I also work with HTML and CSS occasionally. Most of the repositories here are part of my academic learning journey, showcasing basic implementations and ideas.  



### Meaning Behind My Name  
- **Tempest**: Refers to a violent storm, symbolizing chaos or upheaval.  
- **Aethel**: An Old English word meaning "noble" or "honorable."  

Together, "TempestAethel" can be interpreted as "noble storm," suggesting a powerful and tumultuous character with qualities of honor.
