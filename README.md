# My GitHub

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a coder based in Bengaluru, Karnataka, India, with a passion for manga, anime, music, and movies. Here, you'll find a collection of my projects, including games and various web experiments.

## About Me
I enjoy coding and have experience in languages such as C, C++, and Python. Currently, I primarily work with HTML, CSS, and Java. 

### Anime Interests

You can check out my anime interests on my [Anime-Planet](https://www.anime-planet.com/users/TempestAethel) account. My manga section is not updated, but I read them too.


### Meaning Behind My Name
- **Tempest**: Refers to a violent storm, symbolizing chaos or upheaval.
- **Aethel**: An Old English word meaning "noble" or "honorable."

Together, "TempestAethel" can be interpreted as "noble storm," suggesting a powerful and tumultuous character with qualities of honor.
